            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Red Locomotive is a JavaScript game engine for complex 2d and isometric games.
                It give developers <i>tractive</i> effect by abstracting complex systems like the game loop, pixel based
                events, scene management, sprite loading, frame by frame animation, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently Red Locomotive is in heavy development as a pre alpha. It is not ready for use and the api is
                no where near stable. however more information will be added here and on the readme within Red Locomotive
                repository.
