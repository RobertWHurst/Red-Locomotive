            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Red Locomotive is a JavaScript game engine for complex 2d and/or isometric games.
                It give developers the <i>tractive effort</i> they need by abstracting complex systems like game loops,
				pixel/cursor based events, frame rate management, sprite rendering, animation, and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently Red Locomotive is in heavy development. It is not ready for use.
                More information about Red Locomotive will be added here once there is somthing to play with.
